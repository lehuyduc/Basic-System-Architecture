- Download Lehuyduc-Hagidoop.rar and extract somewhere. 
  The .rar file should contain: folder src, TestProgram.java, closePorts.sh 

- “javac TestProgram.java” : this is the auto setup file. 

- “java TestProgram”  : this file compiles .java files in ./src, 
   and copy them to 3 client folders and 3 server folders. 

- In ./server1, open terminal and “java Server 8081”. Do similar in ./server2 and ./server3 (8082, 8083) 

- “java TestProgram 1” : this will execute some shell commands to show what my code can do. 
   After this, ./client1 has test1.reduce and test6.reduce, ./client2 has test2.reduce and test4.reduce, ./client3 has test3.reduce and test5.reduce 

- If there’s “Already Binded” error, run “java TestProgram -1” to close existing ports. 

- From a client folder, you can also try running Split/Launch processes yourself. The syntax is: 
	java Split <filename> <port1> <port2> <port3> … <portN> 
	java Launch <N> <port1> <port2> … <portN> <filename> 

- Note: file filesample.txt has bene modified to remove all French punctuation and convert them to ascii characters.
This make the file much easier to read and run because the code doesn't handle Unicode character.
result_generate_20.txt is the result when we "source ./generate.sh 20"
